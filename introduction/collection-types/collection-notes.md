# Notes

## This is just things I notice or want to clarify upon review.

**In the tuples.py in code8:**
try:
    tup4[0] = "not possible!"
except:
    print("Tuples are immutable!!")
print()


The **try** block lets you test a block of code for errors
(w3schools, n.d)

The **except** block lets you handle the error

The **else** block lets you execute code when there is no error

The **finally** block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except blocks.
